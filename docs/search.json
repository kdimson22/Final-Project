Vaccine-preventable diseases, as in the term name, are infectious diseases that can be prevented by vaccines. Common examples include: COVID-19, Whooping Cough (Pertussis), Measles, and Tuberculosis.\nThere are three main topics covered in this project:\n\nThe project focuses on identifying previous vaccine-preventable disease epidemics in California. An epidemic is defined as “the occurrence of more cases of disease than expected in a given area or among a specific group of people over a particular period of time” (CDC).\nAfter identifying the vaccine-preventable disease with the highest total number of new cases over the years, the project investigated the distribution of the disease across California counties, adjusting for population density. Did the number of new cases vary in different regions? (This is to be explored in the full report)\nOne of the main influential factors to the rise of new cases of vaccine-preventable disease is vaccine hesitancy. When regions do not have a high percentage of people vaccinated, then the community is susceptible to new infections of such vaccine-preventable cases. An example is with Measles, a highly infectious disease that can be prevented with the MMR vaccine. In recent years, regions throughout the U.S. have seen outbreaks of measle cases in regions with a lower vaccination rate. This project investigates if there is an association between vaccine hesitancy and new cases of vaccine-preventable diseases in California counties."

    "text": "Methods\nThe dataset, vaccine, was extracted through the California Health and Human Services Agency, with data collected from the California Department of Public Health. The data includes the variables: ID, Disease (the disease reported), County (the location the disease was reported from), Year (the year that the disease was reported to CDPH), and count (the cumulative number of cases reported of a given disease in a given year, from the specific county). The dataset includes fifteen Disease categories:\nDiphtheria, Invasive Meningococcal Disease, Measles, Pertussis, Tetanus, Mumps, Rubella, Hepatitis A, Acute Hepatitis B, Acute Hepatitis C, Varicella Hospitalizations, Varicella Hospitalization/Death, Chronic Hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae, Perinatal Hepatitis B, and Rubella (Congenital Syndrome).\nIn the data cleaning and wrangling step, counties that recorded 0 cases of a disease were removed. Variety of subsetted datasets were created, subsetting into “california” and “county” datasets since there are some categories in the “County” variable that have a summation number of diseases in California. For each, the filter() function subset. The kable() function was used to print a table of the total number of vaccine preventable diseases reported in the entirety of the dataset. The arrange() function was used to print the top five vaccine-reportable diseases with highest cumulative incidence, as well as to print the top five counties of each disease. Ggplot barplots were used to visualize trends in incidence counts. To analyze the distribution of pertussis cases by counties, I used the leaflet package to code an interactive bubble map, normalized by population density. To visually analyze vaccine hesitancy association, leaflet heat maps were utilized. In the analysis on Pertussis, the data was stratified to compare annual incidence in each California county. In the analysis on Invasive Meningococcal Disease, the data was stratified to visualize bar graphs. All data was analyzed using R software Version 2024.04.2+764."

This included: Siskiyou County, Plumas County, Kings County, and Modoc County as some of the few that stood out in the overlap. However, one of the limitations that was found in this approach is that the percentages of vaccine hesitancy may be too low to capture an appropriate trend nor association. For the survey answer of “strongly hesitant,” the highest percentage was in Siskiyou County with 4.7%, which is still a lower percentage. The highest percentage of “hesitant or unsure” in hesitancy was 14% in Kings, Siskiyou, Plumas, Modoc, Lassen, and Del Norte County.\nAdditionally, another limitation found was in the skewness in the data. Almost none of the counties in the vaccine hesitancy dataset overlap with the Vaccine Preventable Disease incidence dataset. A possibility for this may have been because the statistics of the vaccine preventable diseases focused more in urban, densely-populated counties in California with higher susceptibility of disease transmission. Whereas, the rates of vaccine hesitancy were grouped in rural, less-densely population regions of California."

It was found that Los Angeles county had peaks of case incidence in 2010, 2014, and 2019. After 2020 there was a lower decline of Pertussis cases, but this is likely due to the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic."
